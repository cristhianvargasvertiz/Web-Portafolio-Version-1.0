# Web Portfolio: Only-Code Zone Ahead! This Page is SaaS Free!
This project is a personal web portfolio built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any SaaS or graphical platforms. The site showcases my skills and projects in data science, cybersecurity, digital marketing, and full-stack development. It features a minimalist design with responsive layouts optimized for mobile and desktop viewing. To view the portfolio, clone the repository and open index.html in your preferred browser. Feel free to explore the source code to understand the structure and styling of the site.
